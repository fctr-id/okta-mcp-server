# Logging Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up verbose logging in the OAuth proxy server modules to reduce noise while maintaining important operational and security information.

## Changes Made

### Log Level Changes (INFO â†’ DEBUG)

#### auth_handler.py
- OAuth flow details (state management, PKCE parameters)
- JWT token contents and verification details
- Virtual client registration details  
- Authorization code exchange details
- Token audience validation details
- User info extraction details
- Callback proxying details

#### mcp_handler.py
- MCP request forwarding details
- Tool call execution details (keeping audit logs at INFO)
- Public access tool calls

#### discovery_handler.py
- OAuth metadata serving details
- JWKS fetching and caching details
- Okta metadata fetching details

### Kept at INFO Level
- Server startup and shutdown messages
- OAuth authentication success/failure events
- User consent grants and revocations
- Virtual token creation events
- Audit logs for security events
- Error messages

### Added Features
- `cleanup_expired_entries()` method in AuthHandler for periodic cleanup of expired:
  - State store entries
  - Virtual tokens  
  - User consents

## Result
- Significantly reduced log noise during normal operation
- Maintained security audit trail
- Debug information still available when needed (by changing log level to DEBUG)
- Improved operational visibility with cleaner logs

## Usage
- **Production**: Set log level to INFO for clean operational logs
- **Development/Debugging**: Set log level to DEBUG for detailed flow information
- **Security Auditing**: All security events remain logged at INFO level
