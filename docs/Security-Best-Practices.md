# Security Best Practices Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines how the Okta MCP OAuth Proxy Server implements security best practices in accordance with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices) and OAuth 2.1 security standards.

Our implementation provides enterprise-grade security for MCP clients accessing Okta-protected resources while maintaining compliance with the latest security specifications.

## MCP Security Best Practices Compliance

### 1. Confused Deputy Problem Mitigation

**MCP Requirement:** *"MCP proxy servers using static client IDs MUST obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers."*

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ **Per-Client Consent Tracking**: Each virtual client requires explicit user consent before accessing protected resources
- ✅ **Time-Limited Consent**: User consent expires automatically after **24 hours** to prevent stale permissions
- ✅ **Consent Validation**: Every authorization request validates current consent status before proceeding
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: All consent decisions are logged with timestamps, client IDs, and user identities

**Business Impact:** Prevents malicious clients from exploiting existing user sessions to gain unauthorized access to Okta resources.

### 2. Token Passthrough Prevention

**MCP Requirement:** *"MCP servers MUST NOT accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server."*

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ **Token Validation**: All incoming tokens are validated against our internal token store or directly with Okta
- ✅ **Audience Verification**: JWT tokens must have correct audience claims matching our proxy server
- ✅ **Issuer Validation**: Only tokens issued by our configured Okta organization are accepted
- ✅ **No Token Passthrough**: Clients cannot provide arbitrary tokens for upstream API access

**Business Impact:** Eliminates security control circumvention and ensures proper audit trails for all API access.

### 3. Session Hijacking Protection

**MCP Requirement:** *"MCP Servers MUST NOT use sessions for authentication" and "MCP servers MUST use secure, non-deterministic session IDs."*

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ **Token-Based API Authentication**: All MCP API endpoints use Bearer token authentication, not sessions
- ✅ **Secure Session IDs**: Web UI sessions use cryptographically secure, non-deterministic identifiers
- ✅ **User-Bound Session Keys**: Session identifiers are bound to user identity using the format `<user_id>:<session_id>`
- ✅ **Session Scope Limitation**: Sessions are only used for web UI OAuth flow state, never for API authentication

**Business Impact:** Prevents session hijacking attacks while maintaining proper authentication boundaries between web UI and API access.

## OAuth 2.1 Security Best Practices Implementation

### 1. PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Mandatory PKCE**: All authorization flows use PKCE with SHA256 code challenge method
- ✅ **Secure Code Verifiers**: 64-byte URL-safe random strings for maximum entropy
- ✅ **Verification Enforcement**: Token exchange requires valid PKCE verification

**Business Value:** Protects against authorization code interception attacks, especially important for mobile and single-page applications.

### 2. State Parameter Protection

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Unique State Values**: 64-byte cryptographically random state parameters for each request
- ✅ **State Validation**: Strict validation of state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks
- ✅ **Temporal Binding**: State parameters expire after 1 hour to limit attack windows

**Business Value:** Prevents cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks during OAuth flows.

### 3. Token Lifecycle Management

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Access Token Storage**: Real Okta tokens stored securely for audit and management
- ✅ **Refresh Token Support**: `offline_access` scope requested for long-lived authentication
- ✅ **Token Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired tokens every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Token Revocation Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for future token revocation capabilities

**Business Value:** Ensures tokens have appropriate lifespans and can be managed throughout their lifecycle.

### 4. Audience and Issuer Validation

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Multi-Audience Support**: Validates tokens against configured audiences and Okta org URLs
- ✅ **Issuer Verification**: Strict validation that tokens originate from configured Okta organization
- ✅ **JWT Signature Verification**: Full cryptographic signature validation using Okta's public keys
- ✅ **Expiration Enforcement**: Automatic rejection of expired tokens

**Business Value:** Prevents token substitution attacks and ensures tokens are legitimate and current.

## Security Configuration Details

### Consent Management
- **Default Duration**: 24 hours (configurable)
- **Cleanup Frequency**: Real-time validation + batch cleanup every 5 minutes
- **Scope Tracking**: Per-client scope restrictions enforced
- **Revocation Support**: Manual consent revocation available

### Session Security
- **Cookie Encryption**: AES-encrypted session cookies with secure keys
- **HTTP Security**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie attributes
- **Session Expiration**: 2-hour maximum session lifetime
- **Cross-Origin Protection**: Proper CORS headers for API endpoints

### Audit and Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All authentication, authorization, and consent events logged
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication attempts, token validation failures, and consent violations tracked
- **User Context**: All audit entries include user identity and client information
- **Timestamp Precision**: UTC timestamps with ISO 8601 format for international compliance

---

## Security Headers Implementation

### HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Enables browser XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information leakage

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- **Controlled Access**: Appropriate CORS headers for legitimate cross-origin requests
- **Preflight Handling**: Proper OPTIONS request handling for complex CORS scenarios
- **Security-First**: Restrictive CORS policies with explicit allowlists where needed

---

## Dynamic Client Registration Security

### Virtual Client Model
- **Universal Support**: Accepts any MCP client without requiring direct Okta registration
- **Redirect URI Validation**: Basic URI structure validation while supporting custom schemes (vscode://, etc.)
- **Audit Trail**: All client registrations logged with full details
- **Consent Requirement**: Every virtual client requires explicit user consent

### Client Lifecycle
- **Auto-Registration**: Seamless registration for legitimate MCP clients
- **Scope Restriction**: Client scopes validated against user permissions
- **Security Monitoring**: Suspicious registration patterns flagged in audit logs

---

## Deployment Security Considerations

### Production Readiness
- **JWT Signature Verification**: Full cryptographic validation enabled
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Configurable secure transport requirements
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of OAuth client secrets and session keys
- **Environment Isolation**: Clean separation between development and production configurations

### High Availability Preparation
- **Redis Integration Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for distributed session storage
- **Stateless Design**: Core authentication logic designed for horizontal scaling
- **Cleanup Resilience**: Automated cleanup processes handle service interruptions gracefully
