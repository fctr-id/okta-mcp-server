The [Okta MCP Server](https://github.com/fctr-id/okta-mcp-server) (GitHub) brings real-time access to your Okta environment through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI assistants to securely interact with your Okta tenants through **natural language**.

#### Executive Summary
The Okta MCP Server transforms how AI assistants interact with your Okta environment by providing a standardized protocol layer between AI models and Okta's APIs. This integration enables natural language control of identity operations, real-time data access, and multi-system workflows—all while maintaining enterprise-grade security controls.

**Current capabilities** focus on read-only operations for users and groups, with rapid expansion planned for additional entities and operations in upcoming releases.

#### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP enables AI assistants to interact with your Okta environment in real-time through a standardized interface that allows AI models to discover and use available operations while maintaining security boundaries.

Think of MCP as the "USB-C of AI integration" - creating a universal way for AI models to interact with different services without custom integration for each one. This approach lets developers build tools once that work across multiple AI assistants.

#### Practical Use Cases: The Power of Integrated MCP Workflows

The true magic of MCP servers emerges when multiple tools work together through your AI assistant to create seamless workflows:

>**Note**: These workflows were possible with custom scripts, but the beauty of MCP is that you can build these now with natural language prompts.

* **Export locked Okta users to Google Drive** - "Find all locked users in our Okta tenant, and create a spreadsheet in our IT Operations folder on Google Drive with their names, email addresses, and last login dates."

* **Secure compromised accounts and document the incident** - "For all users who failed MFA more than 5 times today, suspend their Okta accounts, add them to the 'Security Review' group, and create an incident report in our security Slack channel with the details."
  
> **How It Works:** Behind the scenes, the LLM orchestrates these workflows by gathering tools from all MCP servers, identifying which ones are needed, processing your query, and seamlessly passing data between MCP servers/tools using a standardized protocol.

### Key Features and Security Considerations

#### Secure API Integration

The Okta MCP Server provides secure, real-time access to user details, group memberships, and application assignments while implementing least-privilege permissions, fine-grained controls, and robust input validation—with plans to add human approval workflows for sensitive operations.

#### Multiple AI Client Support

The Okta MCP Server supports various AI platforms through the standardized MCP protocol, including Claude Desktop, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Fast-agent, and any other MCP-compatible client.

### Important: Security &amp; Privacy Considerations

Before implementing the Okta MCP Server, understand how data flows through this architecture:

#### Data Privacy with AI Models

When using the Okta MCP Server:
- ⚠️ All Okta data returned by the tools **WILL BE SENT** to the AI model ⚠️
- This data remains in the model's context for the duration of the conversation
- You must be comfortable with your data being processed according to your AI provider's policies

#### Working Within Context Limitations

MCP is designed for lightweight workflows, not bulk data operations:

**Recommendation:** Limit requests to fewer than 100 entities per transaction.

❌ **Not recommended:**
- "Fetch all users from our Okta tenant and analyze their login patterns"
- "Find users who do not have Okta Verify enrolled as a factor"

✅ **Effective:** 
- "Get the most recently created 20 users" 
- "Find users who haven't logged in for 90+ days, limit to first 50 results"

#### Transport Security Warning

The MCP Server offers two transport modes:
- **STDIO (Standard I/O)**: The secure default option, recommended for most use cases
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events over HTTP)**: Has significant security risks - DO NOT USE it without securing the HTTP endpoint

#### What's Next: Roadmap and Future Plans

Key upcoming enhancements to the Okta MCP Server include:

- **Expanded API Coverage**: More Okta entities and write operations
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Approval mechanisms for sensitive operations
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Managing multiple Okta environments from a single instance
- **Integration with AI Agent**: Combining real-time operations with historical analysis

#### Complementary Solutions and Available Ecosystem

| Feature | AI Agent for Okta | Okta MCP Server |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Data Source** | Local SQLite database (synced periodically) | Live Okta API (real-time) |
| **Query Speed** | Fast (queries local database) | API-limited (queries live Okta) |
| **Data Freshness** | Point-in-time (from last sync) | Real-time (current Okta state) |
| **Use Case** | Data analysis, reporting, pattern recognition | Current state verification, real-time operations |

The Okta MCP Server works with other MCP servers like Google Drive, GitHub, Jira, and Slack to create powerful cross-application workflows. Find available implementations at the [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

#### Conclusion

The Okta MCP Server represents a significant advancement in AI-powered identity management, enabling seamless integration between AI models and your identity infrastructure.

#### Appendix: Technical Configuration

#### Sample Client Configuration

For MCP clients like Claude Desktop, add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "okta-mcp-server": {
      "command": "DIR/okta-mcp-server/venv/Scripts/python",
      "args": [
        "DIR/okta-mcp-server/main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL": "https://dev-1606.okta.com", 
        "OKTA_API_TOKEN": "OKTA_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace:
- `DIR` with the absolute path to your directory
- `OKTA_CLIENT_ORGURL` with your okta org url
- `OKTA_API_TOKEN` with your actual Okta API token
