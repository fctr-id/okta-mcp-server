# MCP for Okta: Extending Your AI Strategy

The [Okta MCP Server](https://github.com/fctr-id/okta-mcp-server) brings real-time, agentic capabilities to your Okta environment through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), perfectly complementing the [AI Agent for Okta](https://github.com/fctr-id/okta-ai-agent). 

## Executive Summary

The Okta MCP Server transforms how AI assistants interact with your Okta environment by providing a standardized protocol layer between AI models and Okta's APIs. This integration enables natural language control of identity operations, real-time data access, and multi-system workflows—all while maintaining enterprise-grade security controls.

**Current capabilities** focus on read-only operations for users and groups, with rapid expansion planned for additional entities and operations in upcoming releases.

> **CURRENT STATE HIGHLIGHT:** The Okta MCP Server is in active development (alpha), currently implementing read-only tools for users and groups, with rapid expansion planned. The current implementation prioritizes security and reliability while establishing the foundation for more advanced capabilities.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services in a structured, secure way. It provides a consistent interface for AI systems to discover and use capabilities exposed by servers, allowing AI assistants to extend their functionality beyond their training data.

Think of MCP as the "USB-C of AI integration" - just as USB-C provides a universal standard that allows various devices to connect and communicate regardless of manufacturer, MCP creates a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with different services without custom integration for each one. This "plug-and-play" approach means developers can build tools once and have them work across multiple AI assistants, while users benefit from seamless integration without worrying about compatibility issues.

MCP creates a bridge between AI models and real-world systems by defining:
- A standardized way for servers to expose tools, resources, and prompts
- A protocol for AI clients to discover and use these capabilities
- Security boundaries and permission controls for safe AI operations
- Mechanisms for human oversight and approval where needed

## Available MCP Ecosystem

The Okta MCP Server operates within a growing ecosystem of MCP servers that can be combined to create powerful cross-application workflows:

- Google Drive - File storage and spreadsheet operations
- GitHub - Repository interactions and code management
- Jira - Issue tracking and project management
- Slack - Messaging and notifications

Find all available MCP server implementations at the [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Practical Use Cases: The Power of Integrated MCP Workflows

The true magic of MCP servers emerges when multiple tools work together through your AI assistant to create seamless workflows. Here are some powerful, real-world examples that would traditionally require custom scripts but can now be accomplished with natural language:

* **Export locked Okta users to Google Drive** - "Find all locked users in our Okta tenant, and create a spreadsheet in our IT Operations folder on Google Drive with their names, email addresses, and last login dates."
  
  *Implementation: The Okta MCP Server queries locked users via the Okta API, collects their profile data, then passes this structured information to the Google Drive MCP Server which creates and populates the spreadsheet in the specified location.*

* **Secure compromised accounts and document the incident** - "For all users who failed MFA more than 5 times today, suspend their Okta accounts, add them to the 'Security Review' group, and create an incident report in our security Slack channel with the details."
  
  *Implementation: The Okta MCP Server identifies accounts with MFA failures, executes status changes and group assignments through the Okta API, then the Slack MCP Server formats and posts the incident details to the specified channel.*

* **Generate access review documentation for audit** - "Create a report of all privileged account activities for the past quarter, export it to a secure SharePoint folder, and send me a summary of unusual access patterns."
  
  *Implementation: The Okta MCP Server extracts privileged account activities from logs, the SharePoint MCP Server creates and stores the report file, while the AI analyzes the data patterns and generates the summary.*

These examples demonstrate how the Okta MCP Server functions as a critical component in a broader ecosystem of AI-powered identity management workflows, replacing complex scripting with natural language instructions while maintaining appropriate security controls.

## Complementary Solutions for Complete Okta Management
